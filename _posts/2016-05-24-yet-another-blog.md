Yet another blog spawned and nobody cares! There are a couple of things left to do:

* https using [lets encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
* comment server using [isso]. Why not [disqus](https://disqus.com/)? Beacuse I don't like having their javascript on my page. Also [isso] is OSS and has a freaking Pok√©mon as a logo! Checking their code atm.
