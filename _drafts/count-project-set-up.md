Recently I started working on an app called count. The idea behind is simple:
Count, all the things and visualize the statistics!

![COUNT ALL THE THINGS!!](/static/posts/count-project-set-up/count-all.gif)

Yes, there's a quite a few other counting apps on the playstore already [^1].
The main competitors seem to be:

* [Thing Counter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.sleak.thingcounter&hl=en)
* [Click Counter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.useless.counter&hl=en)
* [Counter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tsukanov.counter&hl=en)
* [Tally Counter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cliff.strichliste&hl=en)
* [Tally Counter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.visiativity.tallycounter&hl=en)

But they are all either extremly ugly, not open source, lack important features
(looking at the comment section) and most importantly don't do much with the
data they are collecting. This is where [count][count-github] should step in.
Providing a simple tally counter but at the same time also collect information
about time and location.

# Where the Project Lives

Like with every good open source project, I spent at least a day choosing a name.
Then I set up a [repository on Github][count-github] and linked it to [IssueHunt][count-issuehunt]
Linking it to [IssueHunt][count-issuehunt] was an important step. I do plan to
release the whole source code open source [^2], but I also want to explore
possible monetization channels which work well for open source development.

For this reason I have planned supporting the following channels:
1. **[IssueHunt][count-issuehunt]** for people interested in supporting one specific feature.
2. **[Liberapay]** for people who would like to support me and my work in general.
3. **In-App purchase** for recurring app users. In order to pay for licenses and infrastructure.

[^1]: And by a few I mean a lot
[^2]: Because open source software is the only way!
