I recently installed [NixOS]. And I love it. (Thanks [Stuart Moss](https://github.com/stumoss)).

In this post I first sum up some lessons learned and then try to dig into some apsects of my configuration.
Please note that I don't want to provide a full reference of the Nix language or the NixOS here.
If you are looking for such, please have a look at the end of this article.

I put my NixOS configuration on Github: [Enteee/nixcfg](https://github.com/Enteee/nixcfg).
Feel free to fork, copy & paste, but note that there are much better configurations out there.

## Lessons Learned

### Stop autoindent with home-Manager manged vim

### SSH Identity Files

SSH identity files can not be stored in the nix-store. Because in the nix-store they are world readable, and we all know ssh does not like this.
There is an open [pull request](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/8) which adds support for private files in the Nix store.
But until that gets merged we have to convert those file paths to strings instead: `IdentityFile= toString ../keys/private/ente-duckpond.ch;`

### Module Imports

Module imports binds the importet module to the namespace of the module imporing:
```
# users/default.nix

  home-manager.users.ente = { ... }: {
    imports = [
      ./ente.nix
    ];
  };
```
```
# users/ente.nix

{ ... }:
{
  /*
   * When imported from users/default,
   * this defines a set in:
   * home-manager.users.ente
   */
  programs = {};
}
```

#### Use rxvt_unicode-with-plugins

The `rxvt_unicode` package does not load custom perl-plugins.
If you want to use such plugins, you should use the [wrapper `rxvt_unicode-with-plugins`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/8f33fb51835324878eb914aa740618b18bc804bc/pkgs/applications/misc/rxvt_unicode/wrapper.nix).

### System Setup

#### HIDPI

* Xorg DPI calculations
* Xresources
* URXVT-Scale font

#### Clipboard Synchronization

X servers use multiple clipboards. I keep them in sync using [autocutsel], which is started as part of the i3 session.

```
services.xserver.windowManager.i3 = {
  enable = true;
  extraSessionCommands = ''
    # Copy PRIMARY to CLIPBOARD
    # -> Make highlighted text pastable with CTRL+V
    autocutsel -fork

    # Copy CLIPBOARD to PRIMARY
    # -> Make CTR+C pastable with SHIFT+INSERT or by clicking the middle mouse button
    autocutsel -selection PRIMARY -fork
  '';
};
```

### Keepass & Otp

For accessing my password store I am using HMAC-based One-time Passwords (HOTP) generated by a YubiKey.
HOTP requires that the password store tracks a counter state of the token.
This means I have to ensure that all systems using that use the very same instance (no copying possible).
Therefore I did put the store on duckpond.ch and mount it using sshfs. This is simple, secure and reliable.

In nix I configured the sshfs mount like this:

```
  fileSystems."/mnt/keys" = { 
    device = "ente@duckpond.ch:/home/ente/keys";
    fsType = "sshfs";
    options = [
      "port=7410"
      ("IdentityFile=" + IdentityFile)
      "noauto"
      "x-systemd.automount"
      "x-systemd.device-timeout=30"
      "_netdev"
      "users"
      "idmap=user"
      "ControlMaster=no"
      "allow_other"
      "reconnect"
    ];
  };
```

As a password store I am using [KeePass] and the HOTP functionality provided by [OtpKeeProv]. Sadly, [OtpKeeProv] is not packaged in nix, yet.
[Pull request #57786](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/57786) should fix this. The following configuragion creates an overlay which
will build the `[OtpKeeProv]` plugin as part of `pkg.keepass'


```
  nixpkgs.overlays = [
    (
      self: super:
      {
        keepass = super.keepass.override {
          plugins = [ pkgs.mine.keepass-keepassotpkeyprov ];
        };
      }
    )
  ];
```
